#STEPS TO USE THIS FILE
#READ EACH COMMENT. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS
#RUN ONE LINE AT A TIME AND OBSERVE THE RESULTS IN THE CONSOLE WINDOW
#DO NOT RUSH. THIS IS EASY, BUT THIS IS THE ONLY TIME YOU CAN LEARN THE COMMON MISTAKES THAT HAPPENS IN R
# #is used for commenting a line. it does not get executed and is not part of the code
#R Tips
#Run: Highlight the entire line, or just put the cursor on the line to Run the code
#Run: Selected a few lines and run the code
#If you only highlight a partial line it will not run properly
#Source runs the entire source file
#check the output on the console
#Keep checking the environment tab often
#If you get an error such as 'object not found' chance are you haven’t run all the code yet. 
#Most test code can be run directly on console. For now, use R Script to save your work
#STEP1: 
#Create a file folder Data Science Camp
#Create Sub folder and name it Week1. Save your work in this file

myname = "Tony" #Run
print(myname)	#Run

#Case sensitive sytax (grammar). what went wrong? fix the error
print(myname)


#ASSIGNMENTS Statements 
# Assign 1 to x. eg x=1 and print it using print(x) or just x and Run
x=1
#Add 1 to x, x=x+1, and Print the value of x
x=x+1
x=2
#Assign names
#uncomment and run the statement below, what happens?
name = Tony

#now remove the # to uncomment and run this statement
name = "Tony" 

#check the environment tab for the variables x and y

#BASIC MATH FUNCTION
#Addition: x=1+2 print the value of x
#add 1+2 assign to x and print the value

x=1+2
x=3
#Subtraction: subtract 5-3 assign to y and print the value of y
y=5-3
y=2
#Division: divide 4/2 and print its value
4/2
#Exponents is calculated using ^ symbol. calculate 2 exponent 3
2^3
#Order of Operations. BODMAS - brackets, OF (multiplication), Div, Add and substraction
c=(100 * 2) + (50 / 2)
c=225

#Check the environment tab to see the value of variables being stored

#calculate square root
m=sqrt(2)
a=sqrt(2887)

#calculate log of a number
n=log(2)
b=log(9)

#VARIABLES
Bankaccount <- 1234
print (Bankaccount)

myname = "Tony"
print(myname) #what went wrong? can you fix and run it?

#Name convention: variables can have a period symbol “.” to separate the two words
Bank.account.number  <- 1234
print(Bank.account.number)

#use of <- for the "most" part <- and = are same. 
variable1 <- "London"
print (variable1) 

# your turn: swap variables. Assign #a’s value to b and b’s value to a
a = 888
b = 999
print (a)
print (b)

# --- add your code here ---# 
#print a and b. a=999 and b=888

c=a
a=b
b=c
